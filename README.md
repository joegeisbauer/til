# til (Today I learned)

## Introduction

This repository is meant to house different things I learn each day so that I can reference them later as needed. I will update something here each week day in an effort to continue learning something new each day. If you find it helpful, please feel free to reference it anytime you like. The hope is to produce runnable code for each post so that you can play around with the ideas in the proper environment and learn from commenting and uncommenting lines in the code.
